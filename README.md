# Mini-Projects

Welcome to the Mini-Projects repository! This collection of projects covers a range of topics in data analysis and machine learning, offering practical examples and insights into various techniques. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project included in this repository:

## Project 1: Flight Delay Prediction

Explore how Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be used to predict flight delays. Using historical flight data, including departure times, airline information, and weather conditions, the SVM model is trained to distinguish between delayed and on-time flights. This predictive model aids airlines and passengers in making informed decisions. Learn how SVM handles high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships.

## Project 2: Feature Selection

Dive into the world of feature selection using NBA shot logs data. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and compare the performance of two feature selection techniques: KBest and PCA. This project helps you understand which method works best for selecting relevant features in a dataset.

## Project 3: Outlier Detection

Discover the significance of outlier detection across different domains. Using techniques like Isolation Forest or Z-Score, learn how to identify anomalous data points within a dataset. This is particularly valuable for fraud detection, network security, and quality control. Explore data preprocessing, model selection, outlier identification, and strategies for enhancing data quality.

## Project 4: Data Wrangling and Transformation

Gain insights into the crucial process of data wrangling and transformation. By cleaning, reshaping, and formatting raw data, you'll prepare it for analysis. This project covers techniques like data imputation, merging, and feature engineering to enhance data quality and make it suitable for further analysis and modeling.

Feel free to explore and learn from these projects, and don't hesitate to contribute or provide feedback.
